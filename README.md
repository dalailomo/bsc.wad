Hello everyone!

I have been working in a collection of maps since a while back and I would like to share it on the wilds.  Its divided in 3 episodes of 3 maps each, although I need to do the final map + the secret map.

EPISODE 1: Playable 100%

EPISODE 2: Playable 100%

EPISODE 3: Playabe 100% (but still unpolished in some places)

Secret map: I dont even remember if it's accesible through normal playthrough, but also need some tweaks (its based\*(copypasted) on another map I did for another thingie)

# Features

* Used some extra enemies from the Zdoom monster pack
* Used some medieval ish textures
* There is some extra spice on the difficulty levels
   * **I just want to relax...** Pretty easy mode, on which you respawn every time you die at the start of the level, but the level does not reload. Ideal to just go through the maps and to chill. A bit experimental though...
   * **Not quite there yet** Quite a challenge already, but bearable with a bit of skill.
   * **Now we are talking** You are in for a ride
   * **Clusterf\*\*\*** This is another experiment. You are a bit weaker, enemies are a bit stronger,  they may throw different projectiles than the normal playthrough, they replace some enemies on the normal playthrough,  your plasma gun does not fire plasma anymore but fires something else... everything is on the MAPINFO
* Remixed songs from the original Doom and Doom2

# Requirements

* Jumping and free look IS required.
* Maps are designed with dynamic lightning in mind so, I m not sure how playable they are if they are turned off.
* Only tried with GZDooM 4.3.3, but I plan to move to this century

# Shenanigans

* Maps are done in a way that you can have multiple choices to traverse the levels. It might feel a bit different than usual, but I wanted to give a bit more freedom in terms of explorarion.
* Even though there are three episodes, you can play them consecutively without loosing your equipment if you start at episode 1.
* Secrets are quite obscure sometimes, so it's always good to check the minimap for clues. Also, discovering secrets is very rewarding.
* All levels have a super-secret that can only be accessed by having the six keys. They are quite obscure and require to pay attention, but if not, it would not be a secret.
* Also, sometimes... a level additionally might have a secret shortcut to the end, if you have the 6 keys.
* Expect bugs and some balancing problems (needs a lot of work on that still...)

I would love to hear your feedback and I hope you all enjoy it.

Probably I will resume the development at some point...

To run it, it just needed to load the pk3 file into GZDooM.
